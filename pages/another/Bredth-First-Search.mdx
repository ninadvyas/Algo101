# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore a graph by visiting all its neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## How BFS Works

1. **Starting Point**:
   - Begin at a starting node (usually the root in a tree or any arbitrary node in a graph).

2. **Visit and Mark**:
   - Visit the current node and mark it as visited to prevent revisiting.

3. **Explore Neighbors**:
   - Explore all unvisited neighbor nodes of the current node at the current depth level.
   - Enqueue these neighbors for further exploration in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.

4. **Next Depth Level**:
   - Move to the next depth level and repeat steps 2 and 3 for all unvisited nodes at that level.

5. **Completion**:
   - Continue this process until all nodes are visited or the goal is achieved.

## Key Features

- **Queue**: BFS uses a queue to visit nodes in the order they are discovered.
- **Optimality**: In unweighted graphs, BFS guarantees the shortest path.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for maintaining the queue and visited nodes.

## Advantages

- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- Good for finding the shortest path and connectivity.

## Disadvantages

- Memory usage can be high, especially in large graphs.
- Not suitable for weighted graphs.

## Breadth-First Search Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Breadth-First Search implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/bfs.js"
function BFS(graph, startNode) {
    const visited = new Set();
    const queue = [startNode];
    visited.add(startNode);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const currentNode = queue.shift();
        // Process the current node
        console.log(currentNode);

        for (const neighbor of graph[currentNode]) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                visited.add(neighbor);
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const graph = {
    A: ['B', 'C'],
    B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    C: ['A', 'F', 'G'],
    D: ['B'],
    E: ['B'],
    F: ['C'],
    G: ['C'],
};

BFS(graph, 'A'); // Starting BFS from node 'A'
```
