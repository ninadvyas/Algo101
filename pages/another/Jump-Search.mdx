# Jump Search
**Jump Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps and then performs a linear search in the jumped segment.**

## Example 
```javascript filename="Searching-Algo/jms.js"
function jumpSearch(arr, target) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const step = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
    let prev = 0;

    // Jump to the block where the target element may exist
    while (arr[Math.min(step, n) - 1] < target) {
        prev = step;
        step += Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
        if (prev >= n) {
            return -1; // Element is not in the array
        }
    }

    // Perform linear search within the block
    while (arr[prev] < target) {
        prev++;

        // If we reach the next block or the end of the array, element is not present
        if (prev === Math.min(step, n)) {
            return -1;
        }
    }

    // If the target element is found
    if (arr[prev] === target) {
        return prev;
    }

    return -1; // Element is not in the array
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19];
const target = 11;
const result = jumpSearch(arr, target);

if (result !== -1) {
    console.log(`Element ${target} found at index ${result}`);
} else {
    console.log(`Element ${target} not found in the array`);
}


```
### In this JavaScript code:

- The jumpSearch function takes an array arr and a target value target as parameters.
- It calculates the jump step size by taking the square root of the array size.
- The algorithm performs a jump ahead in the array until it finds a block where the target element might exist.
- Within that block, it performs a linear search to find the target element.
- If the element is found, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the element is not in the array.

In the example provided, we search for the element 11 in the sorted array arr, and it prints the index where 11 is found (index 5 in this case). If the target element is not in the array, it prints a message indicating that it was not found.
