# Linear Search
**Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.**


## Need To Know:

In Linear Search Algorithm, 

- Every element is considered as a potential match for the key and checked for the same.
- If any element is found equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of that element is returned.
- If no element is found equal to the key, the search yields “No match found”.

## Example 
```java filename="Searching-Algo/ls.js"
public class LinearSearch {

    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i; // Return the index of the target element if found
            }
        }
        return -1; // Return -1 if the target element is not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 6, 8, 2, 9, 1, 5};
        int target = 9;

        int result = linearSearch(arr, target);

        if (result != -1) {
            System.out.println("Element " + target + " found at index " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element " + target + " not found in the array");
        }
    }
}


```
### In this Java example:

- The linearSearch method takes an integer array arr and an integer target as parameters. It iterates through the elements of the array one by one, comparing each element with the target value. If it finds a match, it returns the index of the target element; otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not in the array.
- In the main method, we create an array arr and search for the element 9 in it. If the target element is found, it prints the index where 9 is found (index 4 in this case). If the target element is not in the array, it prints a message indicating that it was not found.
