# Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a collection until the desired element is found or the entire collection has been searched.

## How Linear Search Works

1. **Starting at First Element**:
   - Begin searching from the first element of the collection.

2. **Sequential Checking**:
   - Check each element one by one until a match is found.

3. **Completion**:
   - Stop searching if the element is found or if the end of the collection is reached.

## Key Features

- **Simple and Intuitive**: Linear Search is easy to implement and understand.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the collection.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as it doesn't require additional memory.

## Advantages

- Easy to implement and understand.
- Works well for small collections.

## Disadvantages

- Inefficient for large collections.
- Takes linear time for search in worst-case scenarios.

## Linear Search Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Linear Search implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/lis.js"
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === target) {
            return i; // Found at index i
        }
    }
    return -1; // Not found
}

// Example usage
const array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const target = 30;
const index = linearSearch(array, target);
console.log("Index of", target, ":", index);
```
