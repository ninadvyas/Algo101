# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore a graph or tree by visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## How DFS Works

1. **Starting Point**:
   - Begin at a starting node (usually the root in a tree or any arbitrary node in a graph).

2. **Visit and Mark**:
   - Visit the current node and mark it as visited to prevent revisiting.

3. **Explore Neighbors**:
   - Explore all unvisited neighbor nodes of the current node at the present depth level.
   - Recursively visit these neighbors to explore further depths.

4. **Completion**:
   - Continue this process until all nodes are visited or the goal is achieved.

## Key Features

- **Stack or Recursion**: DFS uses a stack or recursion to explore nodes deeply.
- **Memory Efficiency**: In some cases, DFS uses less memory compared to BFS.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for maintaining the stack and visited nodes.

## Advantages

- Good for pathfinding and topological sorting.
- Uses less memory in some cases compared to BFS.

## Disadvantages

- May get stuck in very deep branches before finding the solution.
- Not guaranteed to find the shortest path.

## Depth-First Search Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Depth-First Search implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/dfs.js"
function DFS(graph, currentNode, visited) {
    if (!visited.has(currentNode)) {
        // Process the current node
        console.log(currentNode);
        visited.add(currentNode);
        for (const neighbor of graph[currentNode]) {
            DFS(graph, neighbor, visited);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const graph = {
    A: ['B', 'C'],
    B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    C: ['A', 'F', 'G'],
    D: ['B'],
    E: ['B'],
    F: ['C'],
    G: ['C'],
};

const visited = new Set();
DFS(graph, 'A', visited); // Starting DFS from node 'A'
```
