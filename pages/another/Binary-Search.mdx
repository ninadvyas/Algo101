# Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It efficiently locates the target value by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It is a highly efficient algorithm compared to linear search, especially for large datasets.

## How Binary Search Works

1. **Array Partitioning**:
   - Compare the target value with the middle element of the array.
   - If the target value matches the middle element, the position is returned.
   - If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half of the array.
   - If the target value is greater, search the right half of the array.

2. **Repeated Search**:
   - Repeat the process in the selected half of the array until the target value is found or the array becomes empty.

3. **Completion**:
   - The search is complete when the target value is found or when the entire array is searched.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Searching**: Binary Search provides efficient search capabilities, especially on large, sorted datasets.

- **Divide and Conquer**: It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to quickly find the target value.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Applications

- **Searching in Databases**: It is commonly used in computer science and information systems for searching through sorted databases.

- **Efficient Searching**: Binary Search is valuable in applications like searching in libraries, search engines, and array-based data structures.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: It is much more efficient than linear search, especially for large datasets.
- **Applicability**: Binary Search works on sorted arrays and is simple to implement.

## Disadvantages

- **Sorted Data Requirement**: The input array must be sorted, which can be a limitation in certain scenarios.
- **Limited Applicability**: It might not be suitable for unsorted or constantly changing datasets.

## Binary Search Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Binary Search implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/bns.js"
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

// Example usage
const sortedArray = [2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 21, 30, 37];
const targetValue = 12;
const position = binarySearch(sortedArray, targetValue);
console.log("Target value found at position:", position);
```
