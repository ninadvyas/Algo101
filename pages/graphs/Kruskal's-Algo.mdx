# Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is another greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. It works by building the MST from the ground up, starting with no edges and adding edges in increasing order of weight.

## How Kruskal's Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**:
  - Sort all edges in increasing order of weight.
  - Create a set to track vertices included in the MST (initially empty).

2. **Selecting Edges**:
  - While the MST set does not include all vertices:
   - Select the minimum-weight edge that connects two vertices in different sets.
   - Add the selected edge to the MST.
   - Union the two sets that the selected edge connects.

3. **Completion**:
  - Continue this process until all vertices are included in the MST.

## Key Features

- **Greedy Approach**: Kruskal's Algorithm makes locally optimal choices to build a globally optimal solution.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: It finds the MST, ensuring the least possible total edge weight to connect all vertices.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph. With a priority queue, it typically runs in O(E log E) time, where E is the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the data structures used. In the worst case, it can be O(E + V).

## Applications

- **Network Design**: Kruskal's Algorithm is widely used in network design, including laying down minimum-length electrical wires or connecting a set of houses with minimal cost.

- **Image Segmentation**: It can be applied in image processing for image segmentation, where it partitions an image into regions.

- **Cluster Analysis**: Kruskal's Algorithm is used for clustering data points in various applications, such as data mining and spatial analysis.

## Limitations

- **Must Be Connected**: Kruskal's Algorithm requires the graph to be connected. If the graph has disconnected components, it needs to be run separately on each component.

- **Doesn't Work for Directed Graphs**: It is designed for undirected graphs. For directed graphs, other algorithms like Prim's Algorithm may be used.

- **Sensitivity to Edge Weights**: The algorithm's performance can vary based on the choice of edge weights. Different edge weight assignments can result in different minimum spanning trees.

## Kruskal's Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Kruskal's Algorithm implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Graphs/krk.js"
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.vertices = [];
    this.edges = [];
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    this.vertices.push(vertex);
  }

  addEdge(vertex1, vertex2, weight) {
    this.edges.push({ vertex1, vertex2, weight });
  }

  kruskalMST() {
    const mst = [];
    const subsets = new Array(this.vertices.length).fill(null).map((_, i) => i);

    // Sort edges in increasing order of weight
    this.edges.sort((a, b) => a.weight - b.weight);

    for (const edge of this.edges) {
      const set1 = subsets[edge.vertex1];
      const set2 = subsets[edge.vertex2];

      // If the two vertices are in different sets, add the edge to the MST and union the two sets
      if (set1 !== set2) {
        mst.push(edge);
        subsets[edge.vertex1] = subsets[edge.vertex2] = set1;
      }
    }

    return mst;
  }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new Graph();
const vertices = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"];
vertices.forEach((vertex) => graph.addVertex(vertex));

graph.addEdge("A", "B", 2);
graph.addEdge("A", "C", 3);
graph.addEdge("B", "C", 1);
graph.addEdge("B", "D", 1);
graph.addEdge("C", "D", 1);
graph.addEdge("C", "E", 4);
graph.addEdge("D", "E", 2);

const mst = graph.kruskalMST();
console.log("Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):", mst);
