# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). It calculates the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph, making it a versatile solution for solving problems related to network routing, transportation, and more.

## How Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) to store the shortest distances between vertices.
   - Initialize the matrix with the direct edge weights where there is an edge, and set it to infinity where there is no direct edge.
   - Initialize the diagonal elements of the matrix to zero (the distance from a vertex to itself).

2. **Iterative Updates**:
   - For each vertex as a potential intermediate vertex in the path:
     - Update the matrix to consider the intermediate vertex and possibly shorten the path from one vertex to another.
     - The idea is to check if going through the intermediate vertex (k) shortens the path from vertex i to vertex j.

3. **Completion**:
   - After iterating through all vertices as potential intermediates, the matrix contains the shortest path between all pairs of vertices.

## Key Features

- **All-Pairs Shortest Path**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph.

- **Versatile**: It works for graphs with both positive and negative edge weights, provided there are no negative cycles.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is O(V³), where V is the number of vertices.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(V²) for storing the distance matrix.

## Applications

- **Network Routing**: The algorithm is used in network routing protocols to find the shortest paths for data transmission.

- **Transportation Planning**: It helps in transportation planning to find the most efficient routes between locations.

- **Games and Simulations**: In gaming and simulations, it can be used for pathfinding and navigation.

## Limitations

- **Complexity**: The algorithm's time complexity is cubic, which makes it less suitable for very large graphs.

- **Negative Cycles**: The algorithm doesn't work correctly when the graph contains negative cycles.

- **Space Requirements**: The space required for the distance matrix can be significant for large graphs.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm implemented in JavaScript with a detailed explanation:

```javascript
function floydWarshall(graph) {
    const V = graph.length;
    const dist = [...graph];

    for (let k = 0; k < V; k++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < V; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] !== Infinity && dist[k][j] !== Infinity) {
                    dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dist;
}

// Example usage
const graph = [
    [0, 5, Infinity, 10],
    [Infinity, 0, 3, Infinity],
    [Infinity, Infinity, 0, 1],
    [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 0]
];

const shortestDistances = floydWarshall(graph);
console.log("Shortest Distances between All Pairs of Vertices:");
console.table(shortestDistances);
