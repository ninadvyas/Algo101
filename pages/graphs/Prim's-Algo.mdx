# Prim's Algorithm

Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all the vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. Prim's Algorithm is particularly useful for network design, such as laying down minimum-length electrical wire to connect a set of houses.

## How Prim's Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an arbitrary node as the initial MST.
   - Create a set to track vertices included in the MST (initially empty).

2. **Selecting Edges**:
   - While the MST set does not include all vertices:
     - Find the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside of the MST.
     - Add the vertex at the other end of the selected edge to the MST set.
     - Add the selected edge to the MST.

3. **Completion**:
   - Continue this process until all vertices are included in the MST.

## Key Features

- **Greedy Approach**: Prim's Algorithm makes locally optimal choices to build a globally optimal solution.

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: It finds the MST, ensuring the least possible total edge weight to connect all vertices.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph. With a priority queue, it typically runs in O(E + V log V) time, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the data structures used. In the worst case, it can be O(E + V).

## Applications

- **Network Design**: Prim's Algorithm is widely used in network design, including laying down minimum-length electrical wires or connecting a set of houses with minimal cost.

- **Image Segmentation**: It can be applied in image processing for image segmentation, where it partitions an image into regions.

- **Cluster Analysis**: Prim's Algorithm is used for clustering data points in various applications, such as data mining and spatial analysis.

## Limitations

- **Must Be Connected**: Prim's Algorithm requires the graph to be connected. If the graph has disconnected components, it needs to be run separately on each component.

- **Doesn't Work for Directed Graphs**: It is designed for undirected graphs. For directed graphs, other algorithms like Kruskal's Algorithm may be used.

- **Sensitivity to Edge Weights**: The algorithm's performance can vary based on the choice of edge weights. Different edge weight assignments can result in different minimum spanning trees.

## Prim's Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Prim's Algorithm implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.vertices = [];
        this.edges = [];
    }

    addVertex(vertex) {
        this.vertices.push(vertex);
    }

    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2, weight) {
        this.edges.push({ vertex1, vertex2, weight });
    }

    primMST() {
        const mst = [];
        const mstSet = new Set();
        mstSet.add(this.vertices[0]);

        while (mstSet.size < this.vertices.length) {
            let minWeight = Number.MAX_VALUE;
            let edgeToInclude = null;

            for (const vertex of mstSet) {
                for (const edge of this.edges) {
                    if (edge.vertex1 === vertex && !mstSet.has(edge.vertex2) && edge.weight < minWeight) {
                        minWeight = edge.weight;
                        edgeToInclude = edge;
                    }
                }
            }

            if (edgeToInclude) {
                mstSet.add(edgeToInclude.vertex2);
                mst.push(edgeToInclude);
            }
        }

        return mst;
    }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new Graph();
const vertices = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"];
vertices.forEach((vertex) => graph.addVertex(vertex));

graph.addEdge("A", "B", 2);
graph.addEdge("A", "C", 3);
graph.addEdge("B", "C", 1);
graph.addEdge("B", "D", 1);
graph.addEdge("C", "D", 1);
graph.addEdge("C", "E", 4);
graph.addEdge("D", "E", 2);

const mst = graph.primMST();
console.log("Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):", mst);
```

In this JavaScript code:

- The \`Graph\` class represents a graph with vertices and weighted edges.
- The \`primMST\` method finds the Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm.
- The example usage demonstrates how to create a graph, add vertices and edges, and find the MST.
