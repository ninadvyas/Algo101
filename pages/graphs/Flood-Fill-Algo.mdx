# Flood Fill Algorithm

The Flood Fill algorithm is a simple image processing technique used to fill connected regions in a two-dimensional array with a selected color. It is often employed for various purposes, including filling areas with a specific color in an image, simulating the "bucket fill" tool in graphics software, and solving puzzles like the "flood-it" game.

## How Flood Fill Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Choose a starting pixel and a target color (the color to fill).

2. **Fill Process**:
   - Check the color of the current pixel:
     - If it matches the target color, mark it as filled.
     - If it doesn't match, stop the process.

3. **Recursive Fill**:
   - Recursively apply the flood fill algorithm to the adjacent pixels:
     - Top, bottom, left, and right (or diagonally if needed).
     - Continue until all connected pixels are filled.

4. **Completion**:
   - The entire region will be filled with the target color.

## Key Features

- **Simple and Efficient**: Flood Fill is a straightforward and efficient algorithm for filling connected areas with a specified color.

- **Recursive Approach**: It is often implemented recursively, but iterative approaches are also possible.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: Flood Fill is generally efficient with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of pixels to fill.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N) due to the use of recursion or a stack.

## Applications

- **Image Editing**: Flood Fill is commonly used in image editing software for filling areas with a specific color.

- **Graphics Algorithms**: It is applied in computer graphics for operations like area filling, anti-aliasing, and texture mapping.

- **Puzzle Games**: Flood Fill is used in puzzle games and interactive applications.

## Limitations

- **Connectivity**: The algorithm assumes 4-connectivity (adjacent pixels to the top, bottom, left, and right) or 8-connectivity (including diagonals). Variants may be needed for other connectivities.

- **Stack Overflow**: When implemented recursively, a deep recursion can lead to a stack overflow. This can be mitigated by using an iterative approach.

## Flood Fill Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of the Flood Fill algorithm implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
function floodFill(image, sr, sc, newColor) {
    const targetColor = image[sr][sc];

    if (targetColor === newColor) return image;

    const fill = (r, c) => {
        if (r < 0 || r >= image.length || c < 0 || c >= image[0].length || image[r][c] !== targetColor) {
            return;
        }

        image[r][c] = newColor;
        fill(r - 1, c);
        fill(r + 1, c);
        fill(r, c - 1);
        fill(r, c + 1);
    };

    fill(sr, sc);
    return image;
}

// Example usage
const image = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1],
];
const startRow = 1;
const startCol = 1;
const newColor = 2;
const filledImage = floodFill(image, startRow, startCol, newColor);
console.log("Filled Image:", filledImage);
