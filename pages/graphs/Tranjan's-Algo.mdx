# Tarjan's Algorithm

Tarjan's Algorithm is a graph algorithm used to find strongly connected components (SCCs) within a directed graph. SCCs are subgraphs where there is a path between any two vertices within the subgraph. Tarjan's Algorithm is widely used in various applications, including compiler optimization, component modeling, and detecting cyclic dependencies in software.

## How Tarjan's Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an empty stack and an empty list to store SCCs.
   - Assign a unique ID to each vertex and initialize a variable for tracking the current ID.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Begin a DFS traversal of the graph, visiting each vertex.
   - As you visit vertices, assign a unique ID to each vertex and push them onto the stack.
   - Keep track of the smallest ID reachable from the current vertex through a variable called "lowlink."

3. **Finding SCCs**:
   - During the DFS, when you encounter a vertex with the lowest ID in the current SCC (i.e., lowlink equals ID), it means you've found a complete SCC.
   - Pop vertices from the stack until you reach the current vertex and form the SCC.

4. **Completion**:
   - Continue the DFS until all vertices are visited.
   - The list of SCCs contains all strongly connected components in the graph.

## Key Features

- **Efficient SCC Detection**: Tarjan's Algorithm efficiently detects SCCs in a directed graph.

- **Linear Time Complexity**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(V + E), making it efficient for large graphs.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: Tarjan's Algorithm has a linear time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the data structures used but is typically O(V).

## Applications

- **Compiler Optimization**: Tarjan's Algorithm is used in compilers to optimize code by identifying and optimizing loops.

- **Component Modeling**: In software engineering, it helps detect and manage cyclic dependencies in software components.

- **Graph Analysis**: It is used for various graph analysis tasks, including identifying strongly connected components in social networks and web link analysis.

## Limitations

- **Directed Graphs Only**: Tarjan's Algorithm is designed for directed graphs and is not applicable to undirected graphs.

- **Not Suitable for All Graphs**: While efficient for many cases, Tarjan's Algorithm is not suitable for graphs with certain characteristics, such as multiple edges between the same vertices.

- **Sensitivity to Graph Representation**: The way the graph is represented can impact the algorithm's efficiency.

## Tarjan's Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Tarjan's Algorithm implemented in JavaScript with code explanations:

```javascript filename="Graphs/trnj.js"
class Graph {
    constructor(vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        this.adjacencyList = new Map();
        this.ids = new Map();
        this.lowlink = new Map();
        this.stack = [];
        this.onStack = new Set();
        this.id = 0;
        this.sccs = [];

        this.vertices.forEach((vertex) => {
            this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
            this.ids.set(vertex, -1);
            this.lowlink.set(vertex, -1);
        });
    }

    addEdge(from, to) {
        this.adjacencyList.get(from).push(to);
    }

    tarjan() {
        this.vertices.forEach((vertex) => {
            if (this.ids.get(vertex) === -1) {
                this.dfs(vertex);
            }
        });
        return this.sccs;
    }

    dfs(vertex) {
        this.ids.set(vertex, this.id);
        this.lowlink.set(vertex, this.id);
        this.id++;
        this.stack.push(vertex);
        this.onStack.add(vertex);

        for (const neighbor of this.adjacencyList.get(vertex)) {
            if (this.ids.get(neighbor) === -1) {
                this.dfs(neighbor);
            }
            if (this.onStack.has(neighbor)) {
                this.lowlink.set(vertex, Math.min(this.lowlink.get(vertex), this.lowlink.get(neighbor)));
            }
        }

        if (this.ids.get(vertex) === this.lowlink.get(vertex)) {
            const scc = [];
            let node;
            do {
                node = this.stack.pop();
                this.onStack.delete(node);
                scc.push(node);
            } while (node !== vertex);
            this.sccs.push(scc);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new Graph(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]);
graph.addEdge("A", "B");
graph.addEdge("B", "C");
graph.addEdge("C", "A");
graph.addEdge("C", "D");
graph.addEdge("D", "E");
graph.addEdge("E", "D");
graph.addEdge("B", "E");

const sccs = graph.tarjan();
console.log("Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):", sccs);
