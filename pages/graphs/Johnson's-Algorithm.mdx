# Johnson's Algorithm

Johnson's Algorithm is a method used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It improves on the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm by using a reweighting scheme and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to efficiently solve the All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem.

## How Johnson's Algorithm Works

1. **Graph Transformation**:
   - Augment the original graph by adding a new vertex and edges with weight 0 to all other vertices.

2. **Edge Re-Weighting**:
   - Apply the Bellman-Ford Algorithm on the augmented graph to find the minimum weight of all paths from the newly added vertex to every other vertex.
   - Reweight the edges in the graph using the minimum weights obtained.

3. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - Run Dijkstra's Algorithm for each vertex as the source to find the shortest paths to all other vertices.

4. **Reversing the Transformation**:
   - Restore the original weights by undoing the reweighting process to obtain the shortest paths.

## Key Features

- **Optimized for Sparse Graphs**: Johnson's Algorithm is more efficient for sparse graphs than the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.
- **Utilizes Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra**: It combines the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms for the APSP problem.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: Johnson's Algorithm's time complexity depends on the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms, making it \(O(V * E \log V)\).
- **Space Complexity**: It has a space complexity of \(O(V + E)\), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

## Applications

- **Routing Algorithms**: Johnson's Algorithm is used in computer network routing protocols to determine the best path between devices.
- **Optimization Problems**: It's applied in transportation and logistics to optimize routes for vehicles.
- **Network Analysis**: Johnson's Algorithm aids in understanding network properties like centrality and connectivity.

## Limitations

- **Computational Complexity**: Despite being more efficient than some algorithms, it can be computationally intensive for large graphs.
- **Sparse Graphs Benefit More**: It's more suitable for graphs with sparse edge connections than for denser graphs.

## Johnson's Algorithm Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an explanation and example of implementing Johnson's Algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Searching-Algo/jhns.js"
// Johnson's Algorithm
function johnsonsAlgorithm(graph) {
    // Step 1: Graph Transformation
    const newVertex = 'newVertex';
    graph.addVertex(newVertex);
    graph.vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        graph.addEdge(newVertex, vertex, 0);
    });

    // Step 2: Edge Re-Weighting
    const distances = bellmanFord(graph, newVertex);
    graph.edges.forEach(edge => {
        edge.weight += distances[edge.vertex1] - distances[edge.vertex2];
    });

    // Step 3: Shortest Path Calculation
    const shortestPaths = {};

    graph.vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        const dijkstraDistances = dijkstra(graph, vertex);
        shortestPaths[vertex] = {};

        graph.vertices.forEach(v => {
            shortestPaths[vertex][v] = dijkstraDistances[v] + distances[v] - distances[vertex];
        });
    });

    // Step 4: Reversing the Transformation

    return shortestPaths;
}

// Bellman-Ford Algorithm
function bellmanFord(graph, startVertex) {
    const distances = {};

    graph.vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        distances[vertex] = vertex === startVertex ? 0 : Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    });

    for (let i = 0; i < graph.vertices.length - 1; i++) {
        graph.edges.forEach(edge => {
            if (distances[edge.vertex1] + edge.weight < distances[edge.vertex2]) {
                distances[edge.vertex2] = distances[edge.vertex1] + edge.weight;
            }
        });
    }

    return distances;
}

// Dijkstra's Algorithm
function dijkstra(graph, startVertex) {
    const distances = {};
    const visited = {};
    const queue = [];

    graph.vertices.forEach(vertex => {
        distances[vertex] = vertex === startVertex ? 0 : Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
        visited[vertex] = false;
        queue.push(vertex);
    });

    while (queue.length !== 0) {
        let u = queue.reduce((min, vertex) => (distances[vertex] < distances[min] ? vertex : min), queue[0]);
        queue = queue.filter(v => v !== u);

        visited[u] = true;

        graph.edges.forEach(edge => {
            if (edge.vertex1 === u && !visited[edge.vertex2]) {
                const alt = distances[u] + edge.weight;
                if (alt < distances[edge.vertex2]) {
                    distances[edge.vertex2] = alt;
                }
            }
        });
    }

    return distances;
}
