# Comb Sort

Comb Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that improves upon the Bubble Sort algorithm. It eliminates small values at the end of the list quickly, which is the main weakness of the Bubble Sort. Comb Sort divides the list into smaller sublists by using a "gap" value, and it repeatedly reduces the gap and sorts the sublists until the gap becomes 1, resulting in a sorted list.

## How Comb Sort Works

1. **Gap Sequence**:
   - Choose an initial gap value, often calculated as the length of the list divided by a shrink factor (usually around 1.3).

2. **Repeated Comparison and Swap**:
   - Compare and swap elements that are "gap" positions apart.
   - Reduce the gap by a shrink factor after each pass.
   - Continue comparing and swapping elements with the reduced gap until the gap becomes 1.

3. **Final Pass**:
   - Perform a final pass with a gap of 1, effectively sorting the list.

## Key Features

- **In-Place Sorting**: Comb Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it sorts the list without using additional memory for data storage.

- **Adaptive**: It becomes more efficient as the list becomes partially sorted during the initial passes.

- **Efficient**: Comb Sort offers better performance than Bubble Sort and similar quadratic sorting algorithms.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Comb Sort depends on the gap sequence. On average, it has a time complexity of O(n^2/log n), which is better than Bubble Sort for large lists.

- **Space Complexity**: Comb Sort has a space complexity of O(1) as it sorts elements in place.

## Applications

- **General Sorting**: Comb Sort can be used for general-purpose sorting, especially when the list is partially sorted.

- **Low Memory Environments**: It is suitable for environments with limited memory since it doesn't require additional storage.

- **Education**: Comb Sort is also used for educational purposes as a simple sorting algorithm.

## Limitations

- **Not the Fastest**: While more efficient than Bubble Sort, Comb Sort is still outperformed by advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort for large datasets.

- **Not Suitable for Very Large Data**: It is not the best choice for sorting very large datasets where more efficient sorting algorithms are available.

- **Choice of Shrink Factor**: The choice of a shrink factor can affect the efficiency of Comb Sort, and selecting the optimal factor can be challenging.

## Comb Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Comb Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/cmbs.js"
function combSort(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    let gap = n;
    let swapped = true;
    while (gap > 1 || swapped) {
        gap = Math.max(1, Math.floor(gap / 1.3));
        swapped = false;
        for (let i = 0; i + gap < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + gap]) {
                [arr[i], arr[i + gap]] = [arr[i + gap], arr[i]];
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

const unsortedArray = [12, 34, 54, 2, 3];
const sortedArray = combSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
