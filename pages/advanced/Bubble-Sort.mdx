# Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## How Bubble Sort Works

1. **Bubble Up**:
   - Compare each pair of adjacent elements in the array.

2. **Swapping**:
   - If the elements are in the wrong order, swap them.

3. **Iterative Sorting**:
   - Repeat this process until the largest element "bubbles up" to the end of the array.

4. **Repeat Until Sorted**:
   - Continue this process for the remaining unsorted elements until the entire array is sorted.

## Key Features

- **Simple and Intuitive**: Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement.

- **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts the elements within the original array without using additional memory.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements.

- **Space Complexity**: Bubble Sort has a space complexity of O(1) as it sorts elements in place.

## Advantages 

Bubble Sort has several advantages, including:

- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement.

- **In-Place Sorting**: It does not require additional memory.

## Disadvantages 

Bubble Sort also has limitations, such as:

- **Inefficient for Large Arrays**: Performs poorly with larger datasets.
- **Quadratic Time Complexity**: Has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it unsuitable for larger lists.

## Bubble Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Bubble Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/bubble.js"
function bubbleSort(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap if the current element is greater than the next element
                [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

const unsortedArray = [12, 34, 54, 2, 3];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
```
In this JavaScript code:

- The `bubbleSort` function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- It sorts an input array by comparing elements and swapping them.
- The example usage demonstrates how to use the Bubble Sort function.
