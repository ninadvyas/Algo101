# Quick Sort Algorithm

Quick Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and widespread use. It follows a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting a 'pivot' element from an array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## How Quick Sort Works

1. **Pivot Selection**:
   - Select a pivot element from the array.

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Rearrange elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot are moved to its left and greater elements to its right.

3. **Recursion**:
   - Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays created on either side of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

## Key Features

- **Efficiency**: Quick Sort is highly efficient and performs well on average.

- **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts the elements within the original array without requiring additional memory.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The average time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n), while the worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).

- **Space Complexity**: Quick Sort has a space complexity of O(log n) for the recursive call stack.

## Advantages 

Quick Sort offers several advantages, including:

- **Efficiency**: Performs well on average with optimal time complexity.
- **In-Place Sorting**: Sorts elements within the original array without requiring additional memory.

## Disadvantages 

Quick Sort has some limitations, such as:

- **Worst-case Time Complexity**: Has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) when the array is almost sorted.
- **Unstable**: By default, Quick Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm.

## Quick Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Quick Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/quick.js"
function quickSort(arr, left = 0, right = arr.length - 1) {
    if (left < right) {
        const pivotIndex = partition(arr, left, right);
        quickSort(arr, left, pivotIndex - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, right);
    }
    return arr;
}

function partition(arr, left, right) {
    const pivot = arr[right];
    let i = left - 1;

    for (let j = left; j < right; j++) {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
        }
    }

    [arr[i + 1], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[i + 1]];
    return i + 1;
}

const unsortedArray = [12, 34, 54, 2, 3];
const sortedArray = quickSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
```

In this JavaScript code:

- The quickSort function implements the Quick Sort algorithm using the partitioning method.
- The partition function is used to rearrange the elements around the pivot.
- The example usage demonstrates how to sort an array using Quick Sort.
