# Radix Sort

**Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit. It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys. **

## Algorithm
The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 

## Code
```js filename="Searching-Algo/rs.js"
// Function to find the maximum element in the array
function getMax(arr) {
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

// Counting Sort for a specific digit (exp)
function countingSort(arr, exp) {
  const n = arr.length;
  const output = new Array(n);
  const count = new Array(10).fill(0);

  // Count occurrences of digits at the current digit position
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;
  }

  // Calculate cumulative counts
  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    count[i] += count[i - 1];
  }

  // Build the output array
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    output[count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
    count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
  }

  // Copy the sorted elements back to the original array
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = output[i];
  }
}

// Radix Sort
function radixSort(arr) {
  const max = getMax(arr);

  // Perform counting sort for every digit position, starting from the least significant digit
  for (let exp = 1; Math.floor(max / exp) > 0; exp *= 10) {
    countingSort(arr, exp);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66];
console.log("Original Array: " + arr.join(", "));
radixSort(arr);
console.log("Sorted Array: " + arr.join(", "));

```

## Output
```
** 
Original Array: 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66
Sorted Array: 2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802
**
```

## Tracing 
Here are step-by-step instructions for tracing radix sort:

**Initial State**: Write down the unsorted array.
Unsorted: **[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]**

**Pass 1 (Sorting by Least Significant Digit):**
The least significant digit (rightmost) of each number is considered.
Perform Counting Sort based on this digit:
**Count: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Sorted: [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]**

**Pass 2 (Sorting by the Next Significant Digit):**
The next least significant digit is considered (tens place).
Perform Counting Sort based on this digit:
**Count: [0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7]
Sorted: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 170, 802, 90]**

**Pass 3 (Sorting by the Most Significant Digit):**
The most significant digit is considered (hundreds place).
Perform Counting Sort based on this digit:
**Count: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7]
Sorted: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]**

**Final State: All elements are now sorted.
Sorted Array: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]**


This tracing demonstrates how Radix Sort processes each digit position, sorting the elements based on that digit using Counting Sort, and progressively builds the fully sorted array. It's important to note that Radix Sort works for non-negative integers, and the number of passes depends on the number of digits in the maximum number in the array.
