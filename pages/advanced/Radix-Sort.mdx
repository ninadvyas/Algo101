# Radix Sort Algorithm

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits. It processes the numbers by their digit positions and groups them into "buckets" based on the value of each digit.

## How Radix Sort Works

1. **Least Significant Digit (LSD) Approach**:
   - Start sorting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

2. **Bucketing Process**:
   - Place elements into separate buckets according to the value of the current digit being considered.

3. **Sorting Passes**:
   - Perform multiple passes through the array, distributing elements into buckets based on each digit.
   - After the last pass, the elements are sorted according to their digits.

4. **Completion**:
   - Continue the process until the most significant digit is reached, sorting the elements in the array.

## Key Features

- **Non-Comparative Sort**: Radix Sort does not compare elements directly, instead sorting by the value of their digits.

- **Linear Time Complexity**: It operates in linear time, making it efficient for sorting integers.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: Radix Sort has a time complexity of O(k * n), where k is the number of digits and n is the number of elements.

- **Space Complexity**: Radix Sort has a space complexity of O(n + k) since it uses extra space for bucket storage.

## Advantages 

Radix Sort has several advantages, including:

- **Efficiency with Integers**: Efficiently sorts integers without direct comparisons.
- **Linear Time Complexity**: It operates in linear time relative to the number of elements and digits.

## Disadvantages 

Radix Sort also has some limitations, such as:

- **Limited to Integers**: Primarily suited for integer values and requires modifications for other data types.
- **Memory Consumption**: Requires extra space for bucketing, leading to higher space complexity.

## Radix Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Radix Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/radix.js"
function radixSort(arr) {
    const max = Math.max(...arr);
    for (let exp = 1; Math.floor(max / exp) > 0; exp *= 10) {
        countSort(arr, exp);
    }
    return arr;
}

function countSort(arr, exp) {
    const output = new Array(arr.length).fill(0);
    const count = new Array(10).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
        count[i] += count[i - 1];
    }

    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        output[count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
        count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        arr[i] = output[i];
    }
}

const unsortedArray = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66];
const sortedArray = radixSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
```
In this JavaScript code:

- The radixSort function implements the Radix Sort algorithm by using counting sort for each digit.
- The countSort function performs the counting sort to sort the elements based on their digits.
