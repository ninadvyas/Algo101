# Insertion Sort

**Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.**

## Algorithm
To sort an array of size N in ascending order iterate over the array and compare the current element (key) to its predecessor, if the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

## Code
```js filename="Searching-Algo/is.js"
function insertionSort(arr) {
  const length = arr.length;

  for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
    // Store the current element to be compared
    let currentElement = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    // Compare the current element with the sorted part of the array
    // and move elements greater than the current element to the right
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentElement) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }

    // Insert the current element into its correct position
    arr[j + 1] = currentElement;
  }

  return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6];
const sortedArray = insertionSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

## Output
```
[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

## Tracing 
Here are step-by-step instructions for tracing insertion sort:

Suppose we have an unsorted array **[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]** that we want to sort in ascending order using insertion sort.
