# Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by continuously taking the next element and inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.

## How Insertion Sort Works

1. **Divide the Array**:
   - Divide the array into two subarrays: sorted and unsorted.

2. **Iterative Sorting**:
   - Iterate through the unsorted subarray, taking one element at a time.

3. **Insertion Process**:
   - Compare the current element with elements in the sorted subarray.
   - Shift the greater elements one position up to make space for the current element.
   - Insert the current element into the correct position in the sorted subarray.

4. **Repeat Until Sorted**:
   - Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.

## Key Features

- **Simple Implementation**: Insertion Sort is simple to implement and efficient for small datasets.

- **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts the elements within the original array without requiring additional memory.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The average and worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements.

- **Space Complexity**: Insertion Sort has a space complexity of O(1) as it sorts elements in place.

## Advantages of Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort has several advantages, including:

- **Simple Implementation**: It is straightforward to implement and understand.
- **Efficient for Small Arrays**: Performs well with small datasets or partially sorted lists.
- **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts elements within the original array without requiring additional memory.


## Disadvantages of Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort also has some limitations, such as:

- **Inefficient for Large Datasets**: It performs poorly with larger, unsorted arrays.
- **Quadratic Time Complexity**: Has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it unsuitable for larger lists.

## Insertion Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Insertion Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/insert.js"
function insertionSort(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let key = arr[i];
        let j = i - 1;

        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
    return arr;
}

const unsortedArray = [12, 34, 54, 2, 3];
const sortedArray = insertionSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
```


In this JavaScript code:

- The \`insertionSort\` function implements the Insertion Sort algorithm.
- It sorts an input array by comparing elements and rearranging them.
- The example usage demonstrates how to use the Insertion Sort function.
