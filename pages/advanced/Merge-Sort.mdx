# Merge Sort Algorithm

Merge Sort is a popular comparison-based sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or list by recursively dividing it into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array consists of a single element, then merging those sub-arrays to produce a sorted array.

## How Merge Sort Works

1. **Divide Phase**:
   - Divide the unsorted array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array has only one element.

2. **Conquer Phase**:
   - Recursively merge adjacent sub-arrays to produce new sorted sub-arrays until there is only one sorted array remaining.

3. **Merge Phase**:
   - Repeatedly merge sorted sub-arrays to generate larger, more sorted sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

## Key Features

- **Efficient and Stable**: Merge Sort offers a stable sorting mechanism and is efficient, with consistent performance across datasets.

- **Divide-and-Conquer Strategy**: It divides the problem into smaller sub-problems and solves them independently before merging.

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) for average and worst cases.

- **Space Complexity**: Merge Sort has a space complexity of O(n) because it requires auxiliary space for temporary arrays.

## Advantages

- Offers consistent, optimal performance across different datasets.
- Preserves stability as equal elements retain their original order.
- Suitable for sorting linked lists.

## Disadvantages

- Requires additional memory space for merging.
- Slower for small datasets compared to other sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort.

## Merge Sort Implementation in JavaScript

Here's an example of Merge Sort implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript filename="Sorting-Algo/merge.js"
function merge(left, right) {
    let result = [];
    let leftIndex = 0;
    let rightIndex = 0;

    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
            result.push(left[leftIndex]);
            leftIndex++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[rightIndex]);
            rightIndex++;
        }
    }

    return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

function mergeSort(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 1) {
        return arr;
    }

    const middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const left = arr.slice(0, middle);
    const right = arr.slice(middle);

    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

const unsortedArray = [12, 34, 54, 2, 3];
const sortedArray = mergeSort(unsortedArray);
console.log("Sorted Array:", sortedArray);
```

In this JavaScript code:

- Merge function merges two arrays in sorted order.
- MergeSort function implements the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion.
